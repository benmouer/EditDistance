This program takes two words and uses dynamic programming algorithms to determine the edit distance between two words. 
For example, the Edit Distance between "Bike" and "Bite" is 1 since only 1 letter in Bite must be edited. 
This type of program or algorithm is in functions like spellcheck where the program must be able to determine what words are "close" to other words in order to give suggestions when a word is misspelled.
